# MusiQLx

## Introduction

MusiQLx is mainly a Subsonic server that aims to skip the idea of having a "Lidarr" within your self-hosted music stack. This will directly fetch metadata and search results from sources such as YouTube Music, MusicBrainz, etc. which will effectively allow users to create playlists and play songs from any Subsonic-compatible streaming clients.

Instead of being a Lidarr alternative, why not eliminate that part of the stack completely. :)

This project will start as a fork of [musiqlx](https://github.com/sentriz/musiqlx) but will not be using it as an upstream for long.

## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> MusiQLx is under active development and is still not yet ready for deployment.
